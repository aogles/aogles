 ðŸŒ¸ Hello world, I'm Amber ðŸŒ¸

-Bio:
- ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ“  I am an Army veteran and a recent participant in the Vet-Tech programâ€”an initiative by the VA to facilitate veterans' transition into technical fields after their active duty service. Additionally, I have recently graduated from the immersive software development program at Carolina Code School.

As a veteran and someone transitioning from the medical field, I deeply understand the importance of community, diversity, and meaningful work. It is my sincere hope that as a developer, I can continue my professional growth in software development while also staying true to my core valuesâ€”work that has a meaningful and positive impact on the community.

I understand that when teams onboard new developers, they are essentially making an investment and taking a calculated risk. However, I am confident that, given the opportunity, I can be an invaluable asset, a dedicated team member, and a proficient developer for any organization. With my professional and technical background, I can assure you that I am someone worth taking a chance on.

- ðŸ’»   Iâ€™m currently working on : My personal portfolio webpage. It is certainly not perfect yet, but please feel free to check it out and give me some feedback!
- ðŸ’¡ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Ruby on Rails and C#. I have also set my own personal goal to complete at least 2 codewars challenges daily so I can continue focusing on the basics and maintain a strong foundation.
